# Submission 2


### Process Level 2
This blog post is about the podcast **Scientific Reasoning for Practical Data Science with Andrew Gelmen** to earn **process level 2**. The link to the podcast, if you would like to list, is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6mq5Esjzfw).


Today I will be discussing the **Philospohy of Data Science Podcast**. This episode focuses on the practical uses of data science and scientific reasoning, with the overall goal of making key ideas of these topics easier to understand. This episode also has a special guest, **Andrew Gelmen**, who is a Professor of Statistics and Political Science at Columbia University in New York. He has worked on numeruous amounts of projects in applied data science as well as other applications in statistics. Recently, he has several books for linear regression and classification as well


In fact, Andrew Gelmen actually ran his own blog with another researcher in order for them to accurately convey their ideas and findings of their research to one another. This blog also featured a *wiki* section in which other people could get involved and make comments or their own findings on the research. Sadly, the wiki portion of the blog got compromised so they shut down the wiki section altogether. However, the original blog is still live and is located at the following [link](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/).


The podcast then goes on to give the listeners/viewers an idea of different classification models, but in simpilier terms. They talk about different modeling tools/classifers such as bayesian modeling, deductive falsification, and so on.


However, a key takeaway from this episode is **why should data scientists care about the philosophy of science?** An important thing about both statistics and data science is that there is no *single way* to do things. The podcast attributes this to the likes of different artisits painting the same model, or different musicians playing the same piece. Although the core concepts are the same, many people have different ways of interpreting data, or what to model or not model.


There are many different kinds of **statistical ideologies**, as the podcast goes into. These kinds of ideologies implant different ideas into people's heads. One such idea could be that *if someone has a randomized controlled experiment with statistical significance, one person could view it differently than the other*. Such as, someone very keen on null hypothesis testing who overvalues results from noisy experiements would view it differently than someone who justifies overally noisy results with outliers.


When considering youir own statistical ideology, there are multiple things to consider:
* You must understand the assumptions you want to make about the data, and why you are making those assumptions
* You must be able to make sense of your own philosophy
* You must be able to connect all of your findings to your larger goals
* You must be able to connect these statements to the world at large to avoid making mistakes by having a narrow mindset or tunnel vision


A lot of these points will help statisticians and data scientists to absolve bias from their data (for the most part) and to also see how their own philosophies and ideologies shape how they interpret their data. Doing this will allow data scientists of all different applied fields (statistics, machine learning, artficial intelligence) to have a greater understanding of data anomalies, and their own **statistical reasoning**.
