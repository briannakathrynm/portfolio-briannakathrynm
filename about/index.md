# About Me
Hello, my name is Brianna MacDonald and I am a Senior at URI with a double major in Computer Engineering and Chinese with a double minor in Cyber Security and Data Science. I've been studying Chinese for about 4 years and I recently had the oppertunity to go to Shanghai and Beijing last Winter right before COVID-19.



# Data Science, to me
Data Science is the intersection between computer science, statistics, and domain knowledge. Data Science has many different uses, such as in medical sciences or in machine learning.

There are many different components of Data Science. The four main components of Data Science are Data Strategy, Data Engineering, Data Analysis and Modeling, and Data Visualization/Operationalization. Data Strategy is about determing what data you want to gather and why. It makes a connection between the data you want to gather and the goals for that data. Data Engineering is about the systems and technology that are used to leverage, access, organize, and use the data. Data Analysis/Modeling is about describing or predicting data, creating analysis and assumptions about data, and mathematically modeling the data. Data Visualization/Operationalization is about visualizing data and understanding how different visuals describe the data, as well as making the data operational by making a machine/person make a decision or action based on the computing of the data.
