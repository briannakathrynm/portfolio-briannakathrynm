# About Me
Hello, my name is Brianna MacDonald and I am a Senior at URI with a double major in Computer Engineering and Chinese with a double minor in Cyber Security and Data Science. I've been studying Chinese for about 4 years and I recently had the oppertunity to go to Shanghai and Beijing last Winter right before COVID-19.



# Data Science, to me
Data Science is the intersection between computer science, statistics, and domain knowledge. Data Science has many different uses, such as in medical sciences or in machine learning.
